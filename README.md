<p align="justify"> Welcome to my PHP Training Space! PHP is a widely-used, server-side scripting language that powers dynamic web development. Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and seamless integration with HTML. It runs on the server, generating dynamic content and enabling interaction with databases and user inputs. PHP is a versatile tool, widely recognized for its ease of use and extensive support for web servers and databases. It powers some of the most popular websites and content management systems, such as WordPress. With its broad range of frameworks, including Laravel and Symfony, PHP is ideal for building dynamic websites, APIs, and e-commerce platforms.
