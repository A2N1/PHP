<p align="justify"> PHP is a popular, server-side scripting language widely used for web development. Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, PHP stands for "Hypertext Preprocessor" and is known for its ease of use and integration with HTML. It is executed on the server, generating dynamic web pages that can interact with databases and user inputs. PHP is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and broad support for databases and web servers. It powers many websites and platforms, including content management systems like WordPress. Commonly used for building dynamic websites, APIs, and e-commerce platforms, PHPâ€™s extensive libraries and frameworks, such as Laravel and Symfony, make it a practical choice for web developers. </p>
